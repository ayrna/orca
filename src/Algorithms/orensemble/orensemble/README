The program implements three large-margin thresholded ensemble
algorithms for ordinal regression. It includes an improved RankBoost
algorithm, the ORBoost-LR algorithm, and the ORBoost-All algorithm.

===Installation===
The program needs to be linked to the LEMGA library by Ling Li. LEMGA
can be downloaded at

http://www.work.caltech.edu/ling/lemga/index.html

The Makefile entry "LEMGA" should be modified for correct linking. 
The program has been tested to work with the 2006/05/16 snapshot of LEMGA.
